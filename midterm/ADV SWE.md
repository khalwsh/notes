#### short notes about different types of Software Development Methodologies
1. Waterfall Model (Traditional & sequential) -> is a linear , step by step process where each phase must be completed before moving to the next
2. Agile Development (iterative and Flexible) -> iterative , flexible focuses on iterative development and customer feedback
3. Scrum (Agile framework) -> happens in short cycles (sprints 2 - 4 weeks)
4. Kanban (Agile framework) -> is a visual workflow management focuses on continuous delivery (Kanban Board Components : To-Do , In progress , Testing , Done)
5. DevOps (Development & operations) -> integrates software development (dev) and IT operations (ops) to enable continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI / CD)

#### State the Engineering Process Requirements
1. Requirements Elicitation     (Gathering needs)
2. Requirements Analysis        (validate needs)
3. Requirements Specification (Documenting Needs) 
4. Requirements Validation      (Ensuring correctness)
5. Requirements Management (Tracking changes)

#### difference between
Various types of software Design patterns
1. Creational patterns (object creations)
	1. singleton --> Ensures only one instance of a class exists (Database connection)
	2. Factory Method --> creates objects without exposing instantiation logic
2. Structural Pattern (code organization)
	1. Adapter --> allows incompatible interfaces to work together
	2. Decorator --> Adds behavior to an object dynamically
3. Behavioral patterns (communication between objects)
	1. observer -> one object notifies multiple subscribers of changes.
	2. Strategy -> select an algorithm at runtime

Different types of software Testing
1. Manual Testing --> performed manually without automation tools
2. Automated Testing --> uses scripts and tools to execute tests automatically

#### what are the best methods for code review
- follow a checklist (code formatting , security , performance)
- keep code changes small and focused
- provide constructive feedback (not just criticism)
- use automated tools like SonarQube for code analysis
